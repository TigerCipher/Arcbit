- [x] Window resize → swapchain recreation (out-of-date handling)
- [x] Raw SDL events forwarded from SDL thread to game thread via a lock-free queue
- [x] `Window` class — RAII SDL_Window wrapper; hides SDL from game/engine headers

---

## Phase 9: Input System
- [x] `Action` registry — map named actions (`"Move_Left"`, `"Interact"`) to one or more bindings
- [x] Binding types: keyboard key, mouse button, gamepad button, gamepad axis (with deadzone)
- [x] `InputManager::IsPressed(Action)` / `JustPressed` / `JustReleased` / `AxisValue`
- [x] Keyboard + mouse support via SDL3 event stream

---

## Phase 10: Settings System

- [x] Graphics settings: VSync, target resolution, fullscreen mode
- [x] Audio settings: master volume, music volume, SFX volume
- [x] Input settings: persist action→binding map from Phase 9; apply on load
- [x] `Settings::Get<T>` / `Set<T>` typed accessors with dirty-flag auto-save

---

## Phase 11: Application & Game Loop
- [x] `Application` class — owns Window, RenderThread, InputManager, SettingsSystem
- [x] `GameLoop` — fixed-timestep update tick separate from variable render tick
- [x] Virtual `OnStart` / `OnUpdate(f32 dt)` / `OnRender(FramePacket&)` / `OnShutdown` hooks
- [x] `main.cpp` reduced to constructing the Application subclass and calling `Run()`

---

## Phase 12: Asset System
- [x] `stb_image` integration (PNG / JPG decode to raw RGBA pixels)
- [x] `TextureManager` — load texture from file, cache by path, return `TextureHandle`
- [x] `SpriteSheet` — load atlas texture + JSON metadata; supports named frames, uniform tile grids, and animation clips in one unified format (see `docs/sprite-format.md`)
- [x] Asset hot-reload stub (watch file mtime, re-upload on change)
- [ ] Carrot engine format import — explicit import only (right-click in editor or `arcbit-pack --import-carrot`); validates Carrot structure before converting, fails clearly if source does not conform

---

## Phase 13: 2D Forward+ Lighting
- [x] `UseNormalTexture` + `UseStorageBuffer` flags on `PipelineDesc`
- [x] `BindStorageBuffer` — bind SSBO to descriptor set (no fixed array limit)
- [x] `GetCurrentFrameIndex` — expose per-frame slot index for SSBO cycling
- [x] `forward.vert` / `forward.frag` — single-pass lit sprite shaders
- [x] Default flat-normal texture in `RenderThread` (fallback for unlit sprites)
- [x] Per-frame light SSBO cycling in `RenderThread`
- [x] `PointLight` struct + `Lights` / `AmbientColor` fields on `FramePacket`
- [x] Point light demo scene

---

## Phase 14: Sprite Batch Renderer
- [x] Per-frame CPU-side sprite buffer (position, UV rect, tint, layer)
- [x] Sort / group by texture to minimize descriptor switches
- [x] Single instance buffer upload + one `Draw` call per texture group
- [x] World-space coordinate system (pixels or tiles); push constant projects world → NDC
- [x] Frustum culling — `Camera2D::IsVisible()` filters sprites before packet submission; uses AABB of rotated viewport so culling is correct at any camera rotation angle

---

## Phase 15: Camera System
- [x] `Camera2D` — world position, zoom level, rotation
- [x] Smooth follow (lerp toward target entity, configurable lag)
- [x] Viewport clamping (prevent camera from showing outside world bounds)
- [x] Screen shake (trauma-based decay; add trauma on hit, explosion, etc.)
- [x] World-to-screen and screen-to-world conversion helpers
- [x] Camera push constant integrated into Sprite Batch renderer
- [x] Camera push constant integrated into Tilemap renderer (deferred to Phase 19)

---

## Phase 16: Custom ECS
- [x] Archetype storage (component pools grouped by component set)
- [x] Entity create / destroy
- [x] Query API (iterate entities matching a component mask)
- [x] System registration + execution order
- [x] Starter components: `Transform2D`, `SpriteRenderer`, `LightEmitter`, `Parallax`, `CameraTarget`, `Disabled`, `Lifetime`, `Tag`, `Name`

### Movement Components (mix-and-match design)
Controller components drive *where* an entity wants to move; style components
define *how* it gets there. Any controller pairs with any style.

**Controller components** (who decides the destination):
- [ ] `InputMovement` — reads input bindings each tick; converts pressed directions into movement requests (deferred — WASD drives FreeMovement directly from game code for now)
- [ ] `AIMovement` — driven by pathfinding / behavior system; pushes movement requests programmatically (Phase 30)

**Style components** (how the entity actually moves):
- [x] `SmoothTileMovement` — lerps from tile center to tile center; plays a walk animation mid-transit; next input queued but not consumed until landing
- [ ] `SnapTileMovement` — jumps instantly to the destination tile; no interpolation; useful for puzzle / grid games
- [x] `FreeMovement` — pixel-perfect world-space velocity; not tile-aligned; intended for live-combat sections where precise sub-tile positioning matters

**Usage examples:**
- Overworld player → `InputMovement` + `SmoothTileMovement`
- Puzzle NPC      → `AIMovement`    + `SnapTileMovement`
- Combat enemy    → `AIMovement`    + `FreeMovement`
- Combat player   → `InputMovement` + `FreeMovement`

---

## Phase 17: Animation System
- [x] `AnimationClip` — ordered list of named frames with per-frame duration; defined in the sprite format JSON (`docs/sprite-format.md`) and loaded via `SpriteSheet`
- [x] `Animator` component — current clip, elapsed time, frame index, playing flag; `AnimatorSystem` advances frames and writes `SpriteRenderer.UV` + `SpriteRenderer.Pivot` each tick
- [x] `SpriteRenderer.Pivot` applied by `SpriteRenderSystem` — offsets the rendered quad so the logical anchor aligns with `Transform2D.Position`
- [x] State machine: `AnimatorStateMachine` component — named states, float/bool/trigger parameters, per-transition condition lists, optional exit-time gate; `AnimatorStateMachineSystem` evaluates transitions and updates the paired `Animator` clip automatically
- [ ] Blend between clips (cross-fade — not applicable to pixel-art sprite sheets; deferred indefinitely)
- [x] Events on specific frames — `"events": ["FootStep"]` in sprite JSON; `Animator::OnEvent` callback fired by `AnimatorSystem` when the frame becomes active

---

## Phase 18: Audio
- [x] Audio library integration (miniaudio via vcpkg — single-header, no runtime deps)
- [x] `AudioManager` — initialize device, master volume control
- [x] Sound effect playback (fire-and-forget one-shots)
- [x] Music streaming (looping background track, crossfade)
- [x] `AudioSource` ECS component (spatial attenuation for point sounds)
- [x] Wire volume levels to Settings System (Phase 10)

---

## Phase 19: Tilemap System
- [x] Tile definition (ID, solid flag, light-blocking, flat, uv_scroll, flip-book animation)
- [x] Chunk-based map storage (16×16 tile chunks)
- [x] Tile atlas texture + UV lookup
- [x] Tilemap renderer (batched instanced quads via Phase 14 sprite batcher)
- [x] Camera / viewport culling (only submit visible chunks)
- [x] Multiple layers (ground, objects, overlay; each layer rendered in order with Y-sort and flat-object support)
- [ ] **Two point light layers** — add `LightLayer` enum to `PointLight`: `World` (affected by tile occlusion) and `Overhead` (bypasses occlusion entirely); overhead lights are used for sunlight, moonlight, magical sky effects, and UI indicators
- [ ] **Tile occlusion grid** — pack `light-blocking` flags for the visible map area into a GPU texture; updated incrementally when tiles change; uploaded to the sprite shader as a new descriptor binding
- [x] **Shadow casting** — CPU DDA raycaster builds a 1D polar shadow map per light; sampled in the sprite fragment shader with 3-tap PCF; `BlocksLight` tile flag drives occlusion
- [ ] Soft shadow quality option: configurable penumbra sample count in `project.arcbit` (default: hard shadows; higher counts add a blur fringe for performance/quality tradeoff)

---

## Phase 20: Font Rendering
- [x] Font rasterizer integration (`stb_truetype`)
- [x] Bitmap font atlas generation at startup (bake glyphs into a `TextureHandle`)
- [x] `DrawText` helper — lays out a string into sprite-batch quads with correct UVs; supports `\n`, `\t`, and `TextAlign` (Left / Center / Right)
- [x] SDF font variant — dedicated screen-space pipeline; engine ships Roboto-Regular for the built-in debug overlay
- [x] Debug overlay — FPS, sprite/batch counts, draw calls, lights, chunk culling stats; toggled via `Settings::Graphics.ShowDebugInfo`

---

## Phase 21: GUI / UI System ✓
- [x] Retained-mode widget tree (`Panel`, `Scrim`, `Label`, `Button`, `Image`, `ProgressBar`, `NineSlice`, `NineSliceButton`, `NineSliceProgressBar`, `ScrollPanel`)
- [x] Input widgets: `TextInput`, `Slider`, `Dropdown`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Switch`
- [x] Anchoring + relative layout (anchor/pivot/offset/size/size-percent per widget)
- [x] Input routing — `BlocksInput` screens consume input before the game; tab/arrow/confirm/back navigation
- [x] Theming: `UISkin` JSON with full color palette + sound key fields; per-widget `SkinOverride`; `.arcui` `"skin"` block
- [x] `Screen` abstraction — push/pop with fade transitions; `BlocksInput` and `BlocksGame` flags
- [x] `.arcui` JSON layout format + `UILoader`; `text_key` localization; `UILoader::RegisterType` for custom widgets
- [x] HUD layer (`HudScreen`): FPS label, controlled by `Settings::Graphics.ShowFps`
- [x] Pause menu (`PauseMenuScreen`): resume, controls, audio, graphics, quit
- [x] Input rebinding UI (`InputRebindScreen`): multi-binding chip list, key/mouse/gamepad columns
- [x] Audio settings (`AudioSettingsScreen`): master/music/SFX sliders
- [x] Graphics settings (`GraphicsSettingsScreen`): VSync, Show FPS, Show Debug Info via `Switch` widgets
- [x] Splash screen (`SplashScreen`): ordered image sequence, per-entry fade-in/hold/fade-out, skip on confirm, `BlocksGame`
- [x] Main menu (`MainMenuScreen`): data-driven `.arcui`, hideable buttons, C++ fallback
- [x] Engine splash: `ArcbitA_withbackground.png` pushed automatically in `Application::Run` before game content
- [x] Skin sound keys wired: `SoundFocusMove` on nav, `SoundActivate` on button, `SoundToggle` on switch/checkbox, `SoundSliderTick` on slider step, `SoundBack` on back-press
- [x] Localization: `Loc::Get(key)`, `en.json` engine strings, `text_key` in `.arcui`
- [x] Engine asset pipeline: `.arcui`, fonts, skins, locale deployed under `assets/engine/` via CMake
- [ ] Editor integration: GUI layouts designed and previewed in the AvaloniaUI editor (Phase 40)
- [ ] Dialog screen (Phase 27), Inventory screen (Phase 25)

---

## Phase 22: 2D Collision
*Custom kinematic-first collision system — no rigid-body dynamics. Full design
in `docs/physics.md`. Covers tile collision, sub-tile entity colliders,
directional arc gating, optional rotation, triggers, and per-style movement
integration. Box2D was reconsidered and rejected — see `docs/physics.md`
"Library Choice" for rationale.*

### Phase 22A — Core types & static collision
- [ ] `BodyKind`, `Collider2D` (Box / Circle, `Rotation` for OBB later, `Layer` / `Mask`, `IsTrigger`) headers + ECS registration
- [ ] `SpatialHash` (uniform grid keyed on tile size) with insert / remove / query
- [ ] `PhysicsWorld` skeleton — owns the hash and the tilemap pointer; tick stub
- [ ] AABB↔AABB and AABB↔Circle narrowphase (rotation==0 fast path)
- [ ] Tile-synthesized colliders from `TileDef.Solid`, with **greedy-mesh** rectangle merging per chunk; rebuild on tile mutation
- [ ] Engine default collision layers (`Default`, `Player`, `NPC`, `Enemy`, `Wall`, `Prop`, `Pickup`, `Projectile`, `Trigger`); user layers extensible from bit 9 upward
- [ ] Debug draw — runtime `PhysicsDebugDraw` flag (kinematic green / static red); toggled from a dev key binding in demo, from the editor IPC channel in Phase 40. **Not** a player-facing setting.

### Phase 22B — `FreeMovement` collision
- [ ] `PendingMove` component + `FreeMovementIntegrateSystem` writes desired delta into it
- [ ] `CollisionResolutionSystem` — swept resolution, slide along contact normal, one re-sweep
- [ ] `Layer` / `Mask` filtering applied in narrowphase
- [ ] Demo: player can't walk through trees / rocks; slides cleanly along walls

### Phase 22C — Tile movement collision
- [ ] `PhysicsWorld::QueryTileBlocked(entity, targetTile)` for the plan-then-commit flow
- [ ] `TileMovementPlanSystem` integrates `SmoothTileMovement` (and `SnapTileMovement` when added) with the query before a tile transition is committed
- [ ] Demo: tile-style player can't enter solid tiles; queued-input-during-transit semantics preserved

### Phase 22D — Directional collision (arcs)
- [ ] `DirectionArc` type (`{ centerDeg, halfWidthDeg }`) + preset library (`AllDirections`, `Vertical`, `Horizontal`, `NorthOnly`, ...)
- [ ] Narrowphase emits a contact direction; arc check filters blocking contacts. Arcs evaluated in the collider's **local frame** so they rotate with the body
- [ ] `TileDef.BlockedFrom` field (vector of arcs); tile-loader / atlas-spec support
- [ ] Demo: tree blocks top/bottom approaches but allows walking under from the sides; verify off-axis approach behaviour for free movement

### Phase 22E — Rotated colliders (OBB)
- [ ] OBB↔OBB narrowphase (SAT) and OBB↔Circle (transform-into-local)
- [ ] OBB sweep — substepping fallback for Phase 22 (split into N small AABB-of-OBB-bounds steps); promote to true OBB sweep only if profiling demands. Rotation is rare.
- [ ] Demo: rotated chest blocks correctly; rotating prop carries its directional arc with it

### Phase 22F — Triggers & events
- [ ] `IsTrigger` flag on `Collider2D`
- [ ] `TriggerCallback` and `CollisionCallback` ECS components
- [ ] Per-pair persistent set diffed each tick → `OnEnter` / `OnExit` (and `OnStay` for triggers only)
- [ ] Demo: door / warp-tile trigger teleports the player on enter

### Phase 22G — Polish & integration
- [ ] Optional `SmoothTileMovement.AllowPartialMove` — sub-tile stop policy for the rare scenes that want it
- [ ] Event Bus publishing (`Collision.Started`, `Collision.Ended`, `Trigger.Entered`, `Trigger.Exited`) — wired when Phase 24 lands; callback API is the integration surface until then
- [ ] Editor integration (Phase 40) — collider authoring panel, live preview, directional-arc arrows on the canvas

---

## Phase 23: Scene Management
- [ ] `Scene` class — owns an ECS world, tilemap, active lights, and camera
- [ ] `SceneManager` — load / unload / transition between scenes
- [ ] Async streaming: load next scene in background while current scene is still running
- [ ] Transition effects (fade-to-black, crossfade) using the GUI system (Phase 21)
- [ ] Scene stack for overlays (e.g. pop up an inventory screen over the world without unloading it)
- [ ] Entry-point scene configured in `project.arcbit` (Phase 37)

---

## Phase 24: Event Bus
- [ ] Named pub/sub message bus: `EventBus::Subscribe(eventName, callback)` / `Unsubscribe` / `Publish(eventName, payload)`
- [ ] Typed payload: `EventPayload` — flexible container for arbitrary per-event data (discriminated union or `std::any`)
- [ ] Deferred dispatch mode: events queued during the update tick and flushed at the start of the next tick to prevent re-entrant callback issues
- [ ] Predefined engine events:
  - *Scene:* `Scene.Loaded`, `Scene.Unloaded`
  - *Persistence:* `Game.Saved`, `Game.Loaded`
  - *Entities:* `Entity.Spawned(entityId)`, `Entity.Destroyed(entityId)`
  - *World:* `DayNight.Changed(normalizedTime)`, `Weather.Changed(type)`
  - *Dialog:* `Dialog.Started(graphId)`, `Dialog.Ended(graphId, lastChoice)`
  - *Combat:* `Combat.Started`, `Combat.Ended(result)`, `Player.Died`, `Player.Respawned`
  - *Input:* `Input.DeviceChanged(deviceType)` — e.g. keyboard → gamepad, used to swap UI hint icons
  - *Items:* `Item.PickedUp(itemId, entityId)`, `Item.Dropped(itemId, entityId)`
  - *Progression:* `Quest.Started(questId)`, `Quest.Completed(questId)`, `Player.LeveledUp(newLevel)`, `Achievement.Unlocked(achievementId)`
- [ ] User-definable events: any string key outside the reserved `engine.*` namespace is valid; game code and Lua scripts may publish and subscribe freely
- [ ] Lua integration: `Event.Subscribe("name", handler)`, `Event.Unsubscribe`, `Event.Publish("name", payload)` — exposed in Phase 26 Lua scripting
- [ ] Editor integration: live event monitor panel in the running game showing event name, payload, and source (Phase 40)

---

## Phase 25: Save / Load System
- [ ] `SaveSlot` — versioned binary or JSON snapshot of game state (separate from settings)
- [ ] Captured state: player position + scene, inventory, quest flags, NPC states, world mutations
- [ ] Multiple save slots with metadata (timestamp, playtime, thumbnail screenshot)
- [ ] Auto-save trigger API (on scene transition, on rest, on checkpoint)
- [ ] Migration / version-upgrade path so old saves stay compatible after content updates
- [ ] Lua API exposure so scripts can read and write custom save keys
- [ ] Publishes `Game.Saved` and `Game.Loaded` via the Event Bus (Phase 24) on completion

---

## Phase 26: Lua Scripting
- [ ] Lua integration (sol2 via vcpkg)
- [ ] Script component (path to `.lua` file, loaded via asset system)
- [ ] Core lifecycle hooks: `OnStart`, `OnUpdate(dt)`, `OnDestroy`
- [ ] Entity hooks: `OnInteract`, `OnCombatStart`, `OnCombatEnd`
- [ ] `OnEvent(eventName, payload)` — called when a subscribed event fires; scripts call `Event.Subscribe` in `OnStart` to opt in
- [ ] Engine API surface: ECS queries, entity create/destroy, component read/write
- [ ] Tilemap API: read/write tile properties, trigger map mutations
- [ ] Scene API: load scene, change entry point, spawn entities
- [ ] Save API: read/write custom save keys (Phase 25)
- [ ] Input API: query action state from scripts
- [ ] Audio API: play sound/music from scripts
- [ ] Event API: `Event.Subscribe`, `Event.Unsubscribe`, `Event.Publish` (Phase 24)
- [ ] Sandboxed execution: scripts cannot access filesystem or network directly

---

## Phase 27: Dialog / Conversation System
*Default implementation — can be replaced by a Lua script if the game dev prefers a custom system.*

- [ ] `DialogGraph` — node-based conversation tree (speak, choice, condition, branch, action)
- [ ] Node types: `SpeakNode` (portrait, speaker name, text), `ChoiceNode` (up to N options), `ConditionNode` (check quest flag / inventory / stat), `ActionNode` (run Lua callback)
- [ ] `DialogManager` — queue and advance dialogs; integrates with GUI system (Phase 21) for the dialog box UI
- [ ] Interactable tile and NPC trigger: `OnInteract` starts a named dialog graph
- [ ] All displayed text referenced by localization key (Phase 28); raw strings are never embedded
- [ ] Variable substitution in text (`{player_name}`, `{gold_count}`, etc.) resolved via Localization interpolation
- [ ] Typewriter reveal effect with configurable speed; skip on confirm input
- [ ] Portraits / speaker icons per node (optional; falls back to name-only if absent)
- [ ] JSON authoring format; importable from editor (Phase 40)
- [ ] Lua hook: `OnDialogEnd(graphId, lastChoice)` for scripted reactions
- [ ] Publishes `Dialog.Started` and `Dialog.Ended` events via the Event Bus (Phase 24)

---

## Phase 28: Localization
*English is required. All other languages are optional. The system is always active — it is the canonical way to define any player-visible text.*

- [ ] String key convention: all player-visible text in dialog, GUI, items, and combat is authored as a key (e.g. `"npc.elder.greeting"`) rather than a raw string
- [ ] Language resource files: one JSON file per locale (`en.json`, `ja.json`, etc.); keys map to translated strings
- [ ] `LocaleManager` — loads a locale file at startup (default: `en`); hot-swappable at runtime for in-game language selection
- [ ] `L("key")` / `Localize("key")` helper resolves a key to the active locale string; falls back to English if the key is missing in the target locale
- [ ] Fallback chain: requested locale → English → key string itself (so missing translations never crash or show blank)
- [ ] Plural forms: keys can define `_one` / `_other` variants (e.g. `"item.gold_one"` = "1 Gold", `"item.gold_other"` = "{count} Gold")
- [ ] String interpolation: `{player_name}`, `{count}`, `{item_name}` placeholders resolved at call site
- [ ] **Export pipeline**: editor scans all dialog graphs, GUI layouts, item definitions, and combat text; emits a canonical `en.json` with every key and its English value; translator-ready
- [ ] Language selection UI in settings screen (Phase 21); persisted in settings file (Phase 10)
- [ ] Editor integration (Phase 40): inline key picker, missing-key warnings, locale coverage report (% of keys translated per locale)

---

## Phase 29: Inventory & Items
- [ ] Item definition (ID, name, description, icon, stat block, type flags: consumable / equipment / key); all player-visible strings use localization keys (Phase 28)
- [ ] `Inventory` component — item slots with quantities; max-stack configurable per item type
- [ ] Pick-up / drop / equip / unequip logic; equip slots (weapon, armor, accessory, etc.)
- [ ] **Grid view**: icon-based inventory panel (like classic RPGs); drag-and-drop reorder
- [ ] **List view**: name + quantity rows (Pokémon-style); keyboard/gamepad navigable
- [ ] Both views built on the GUI system (Phase 21) and switchable at runtime
- [ ] Equipment stat application: `EquipmentSystem` aggregates equipped item bonuses onto a `Stats` component
- [ ] Loot tables: weighted random drops defined in JSON
- [ ] Save / load integration (Phase 25)
- [ ] Lua API: add/remove/check items from scripts
- [ ] Publishes `Item.PickedUp` and `Item.Dropped` events via the Event Bus (Phase 24)

---

## Phase 30: AI & Pathfinding
- [ ] `NavGrid` — walkability grid derived from tilemap solid flags; rebuilt on map mutation
- [ ] A\* pathfinding with diagonal movement option; path smoothing (string-pulling)
- [ ] Steering behaviors: `Follow` (track target), `Wander` (random walk), `Flee` (move away from threat)
- [ ] `AIController` ECS component — configurable behavior tree or state machine
- [ ] Line-of-sight check (raytrace against solid tiles; used for perception radius)
- [ ] Patrol paths: series of waypoints defined per NPC in the editor
- [ ] Awareness states: `Idle → Alert → Chase → Combat` transitions
- [ ] Turn-based AI: action selection (attack / use item / move) driven by heuristics or Lua script
- [ ] Real-time AI: target acquisition, attack range check, cooldown management (used in Phase 32)
- [ ] Debug overlay: draw paths, awareness radius, LOS rays

---

## Phase 31: Turn-Based Combat
- [ ] Battle state machine (idle → select action → resolve → end check)
- [ ] Action queue (Pokémon-style turn order by speed stat)
- [ ] Move / stat system (HP, MP, ATK, DEF, SPD, type affinities)
- [ ] Status effects (poison, stun, burn, etc.) applied and ticked per turn
- [ ] Combat UI (health/MP bars, action menu, move list, enemy info panel); all text via localization keys (Phase 28)
- [ ] Transition in/out of battle (trigger from overworld collision or script)
- [ ] Basic combat animations (Phase 17 clip playback) for attack and hurt reactions
- [ ] Rewards: XP, gold, item drops via loot tables (Phase 29)
- [ ] Lua hooks: `OnBattleStart`, `OnTurnStart`, `OnActionResolved`, `OnBattleEnd`
- [ ] Publishes `Combat.Started` and `Combat.Ended` events via the Event Bus (Phase 24)

---

## Phase 32: Live Combat
*Alternative to turn-based — toggled per encounter or globally by the game dev.*

- [ ] Real-time hitbox system: attack hitboxes active for specific animation frames (Phase 17 frame events)
- [ ] Melee combat: swing arc collider, hit detection, knockback impulse
- [ ] Ranged combat: projectile entity spawned at fire point, moves each tick, destroyed on hit or range
- [ ] Dodge / dash: brief i-frame window, directional impulse
- [ ] Enemy AI in real-time (Phase 30): target acquisition, attack wind-up telegraphing, retreat at low HP
- [ ] Combo system: input sequence maps to chained attacks (optional; data-driven per weapon type)
- [ ] Screen effects: hit-stop (brief time-scale reduction), screen flash, camera shake (Phase 15)
- [ ] Boss encounter flag: phase transitions at HP thresholds, scripted via Lua
- [ ] Publishes `Combat.Started`, `Combat.Ended`, `Player.Died`, and `Player.Respawned` events via the Event Bus (Phase 24)

---

## Phase 33: Particle System
- [ ] CPU-side particle pool: position, velocity, lifetime, color/alpha, scale — fixed-size ring buffer
- [ ] Emitter component: shape (point, line, circle, cone), burst vs. continuous mode, rate
- [ ] Per-particle modifiers: gravity, drag, color-over-lifetime, scale-over-lifetime
- [ ] Render: batched into sprite batcher as textured quads; sorted by layer
- [ ] Preset library: spark, smoke, blood splash, magic aura, footstep dust, rain, snow
- [ ] Lua API: spawn named emitter at world position, stop/pause emitter
- [ ] Editor integration: preview emitters in the editor canvas (Phase 40)

---

## Phase 34: Visual Effects
*Renderer changes required: offscreen render target, multi-pass `RenderFrame`, per-sprite shader variant selection, line renderer vertex path.*

- [ ] **Post-processing pipeline**: scene rendered to an offscreen color target; fullscreen passes applied before presenting; each pass individually toggleable and configurable in `project.arcbit`
- [ ] Built-in post-processing effects: bloom (bright pixel extraction + Gaussian blur + additive composite), vignette, chromatic aberration, color grading via a 1D LUT texture
- [ ] **Light animation**: `LightAnimator` component — curve-driven intensity, color, and radius over time; built-in presets: flicker (fire / broken lamp), pulse (magic aura), candle, strobe; custom curves authored in the editor (Phase 40)
- [ ] **Sprite material effects**: per-sprite `MaterialEffect` field on the `Sprite` struct; built-in variants:
  - `Dissolve` — noise-based alpha cutoff controlled by a threshold parameter; used for death / spawn transitions
  - `Outline` — renders a colored rim around the sprite boundary; used to show silhouettes of entities occluded behind walls
  - `HitFlash` — RGBA tint pulse driven by a timer; wired to the combat hurt reaction
- [ ] **Line renderer**: `DrawLine(start, end, width, color, style)` for lasers, lightning, and ropes; rendered as a screen-aligned quad with SDF-based anti-aliasing; style variants: solid, dashed, glow
- [ ] **Weather overlay**: `WeatherSystem` drives a configurable overlay layer — rain (particle shower + screen-space streak pass), snow (particle drift), fog (animated Perlin noise fullscreen overlay with density and tint); weather type changes publish `Weather.Changed` via the Event Bus (Phase 24)

---

## Phase 35: Cutscene & Event Sequence System
- [ ] `EventSequence` — ordered list of timed commands (timeline-style)
- [ ] Command types: `MoveCameraTo`, `PanCamera`, `PlayAnimation`, `PlaySound`, `ShowDialog`, `FadeScreen`, `WaitSeconds`, `WaitForInput`, `SetFlag`, `RunLua`, `PublishEvent`
- [ ] `EventTrigger` tile/entity property — starts a named sequence when entered or interacted with
- [ ] Sequence authoring in JSON; imported and previewed in editor (Phase 40)
- [ ] Skippable flag per sequence (skip jumps to end, fires all `SetFlag` / `RunLua` / `PublishEvent` commands immediately)
- [ ] Supports both in-engine cutscenes and background story events (no camera override needed)

---

## Phase 36: Content Tools
*A shared `arcbit-content` DLL consumed by both the engine and the AvaloniaUI editor, ensuring identical read/write logic for all binary asset formats.*

- [ ] `.arcasset` binary container format: magic bytes, version, table of contents, compressed payload sections
- [ ] Supported asset types in v1: `Texture` (raw pixels + metadata), `SpriteSheet` (texture + UV table), `AnimationClip` (frame list + events), `TileAtlas` (texture + tile property table), `AudioClip` (decoded PCM + loop points), `FontAtlas` (glyph texture + metrics), `UILayout` (compiled `.arcui` data blob)
- [ ] **Texture atlas packer**: bin individual sprites and spritesheets into power-of-two atlas pages grouped by sampler type (nearest / linear); output UV mapping table in `.arcasset` so game code still refers to sprites by name; `arcbit-pack` supports `--atlas` mode for batch packing
- [ ] Import pipeline: source file (PNG, JSON, WAV, TTF, `.arcui`, etc.) → validated → packed into `.arcasset`
- [ ] Export pipeline: `.arcasset` → engine `TextureHandle` / `AudioClip` / `FontAtlas` / etc. at runtime
- [ ] **Migration — font registry**: `UILoader::FontRegistry` (currently populated by manual `UILoader::RegisterFont()` calls at startup) should be replaced by asset-driven loading — `FontAtlas` assets are loaded through the content pipeline and auto-registered under their asset key so `.arcui` skin blocks can reference them by name without any hand-wiring in game code
- [ ] **Migration — UI texture references**: `NineSliceButton`, `NineSliceProgressBar`, and `Image` widgets currently require texture/sampler handles to be assigned in code (no asset registry exists yet); once the content pipeline is in place, `.arcui` files should support a `"texture": "ui/button_normal"` key that resolves to a `TextureHandle` through the asset registry at load time
- [ ] **Everything through arcbit-pack**: `.arcui` layout files, tilemap atlases, fonts, and all other engine-consumed data must be packed and loaded exclusively via the `arcbit-pack` / `.arcasset` pipeline — no raw file reads at runtime outside of the content tools themselves
- [ ] **Two-key asset protection system**:
  - *Dev key*: generated per project, stored in the dev's `project.arcbit` (never shipped with the game); baked into the game binary by the packaging step at build time; required to open `.arcasset` files in full editor mode
  - *Mod key*: a separate per-project key included in the shipped `project.arcbit` only when `mod_support = true`; used to sign assets produced by end users in mod editor mode; engine distinguishes mod assets from dev assets by key
  - When `mod_support = false`, shipped builds contain no key material; `.arcasset` files are opaque to end users (obfuscation, not hard encryption — raises the bar for casual extraction)
- [ ] **Mod editor mode** (activated when the editor opens a shipped `project.arcbit` with `mod_support = true`):
  - Open and preview original dev assets (decrypted in memory via the mod key where possible, or by asking the game runtime)
  - Extract audio and image assets to standard formats (WAV, PNG, etc.) for use as mod source material
  - "Save" is disabled on original assets — only "Save as Mod" is available, which always writes to the project's `mods/` directory signed with the mod key; original `.arcasset` files are never overwritten
- [ ] Hot-reload: engine watches `.arcasset` mtime and re-imports on change (extends Phase 12 stub)
- [ ] CLI tool (`arcbit-pack`) for batch import from a source assets directory

---

## Phase 37: Mod Support
*Optional — enabled per project in `project.arcbit`.*

- [ ] Mod discovery: scan a `mods/` folder for subdirectories, each containing a `mod.json` manifest
- [ ] `mod.json`: mod ID, display name, version, load order, list of Lua entry scripts
- [ ] Load order resolution: mods declare soft dependencies; engine topologically sorts them
- [ ] Lua mod API extensions (on top of Phase 26): `Entity.Spawn`, `Tilemap.SetTile`, `ItemRegistry.Register`, `DialogRegistry.Register`, `Event.Subscribe`
- [ ] Asset override: mod can shadow engine assets by placing an `.arcasset` at the same relative path; mod assets must be signed with the mod key (produced by the mod editor) — the engine rejects any file signed with the dev key that did not ship with the game
- [ ] Conflict detection: warn when two mods override the same asset or define the same item ID
- [ ] Mod can be disabled at runtime; save system tags which mods were active (warn on load if missing)
- [ ] Steam Workshop integration: wires into mod discovery when `steam_workshop = true` in `project.arcbit` (requires Phase 39)

---

## Phase 38: Data-Driven Runtime
- [ ] `project.arcbit` JSON project file format (title, resolution, entry scene, asset/script paths, mod support flag)
- [ ] `runtime/` CMake project — generic, pre-compiled Application host with no game-specific code
- [ ] Project file loader replaces hardcoded `ApplicationConfig` in the runtime path
- [ ] Lua hook wiring: `OnStart` loads entry scene, `OnUpdate(dt)` dispatches to Lua `OnUpdate`, etc.
- [ ] Defined export folder layout (`runtime.exe`, `project.arcbit`, `assets/`, `scenes/`, `scripts/`, `shaders/`, `mods/`)
- [ ] C++ subclass path (`game/`) remains fully supported alongside the data-driven path

---

## Phase 39: Steam / Platform Integration
*Optional — enabled per project. Requires a Steamworks SDK license (free for Steam distribution).*

- [ ] Steamworks SDK integration (dynamic DLL load; gracefully no-ops when Steam is not running)
- [ ] Steam initialization: `SteamAPI_Init` on startup, `SteamAPI_RunCallbacks` each tick, `SteamAPI_Shutdown` on exit
- [ ] Achievements: `AchievementManager` with named achievements defined in `project.arcbit`; unlock via `AchievementManager::Unlock("ACH_FIRST_BATTLE")`; synced to Steam backend; publishes `Achievement.Unlocked` via Event Bus (Phase 24)
- [ ] Stats: integer / float stats (playtime, enemies defeated, etc.) submitted to Steam leaderboards
- [ ] Cloud saves: `SteamRemoteStorage` mirrors the save slot files from Phase 25; conflict resolution (newest wins or user prompt)
- [ ] Rich presence: set activity string shown in Steam friends list (e.g. "Exploring the Forest")
- [ ] Steam overlay: ensure `SDL_Window` is correctly set up for the overlay to render (Vulkan surface compatible)
- [ ] DLC flag system: `SteamApps::BIsDlcInstalled(appId)` gates content; checked at asset load time
- [ ] Steam Workshop: full discovery + download pipeline (extends the stub in Phase 37)
- [ ] Build pipeline: `steam_appid.txt` present in output directory; packaging script generates depot manifests

---

## Phase 40: C# AvaloniaUI Editor
- [ ] Separate solution / CMake-independent project
- [ ] Tilemap canvas (render tiles, layer management)
- [ ] Tile palette + placement / erase tools
- [ ] Tile property editor panel (solid, light-blocking, interactable, custom properties)
- [ ] NPC placement + script file assignment
- [ ] Dialog graph editor (node canvas for Phase 27 conversation trees)
- [ ] Event sequence editor (timeline view for Phase 35 cutscene commands)
- [ ] GUI layout designer (drag-and-drop widget canvas for Phase 21 screens)
- [ ] **Font registry panel** (part of asset browser): register loaded `FontAtlas` instances under string keys so `.arcui` skin blocks can reference fonts by name (`"Font": "roboto"`); call `UILoader::RegisterFont(key, atlas)` at startup from game code or project config; editor needs UI to add/remove/rename entries and preview each registered font
- [ ] Particle emitter preview panel (live preview of Phase 33 emitter configs)
- [ ] Visual effects panel: light animator curve editor, weather overlay preview, material effect preview (Phase 34)
- [ ] Localization tools: key picker, `en.json` export, per-locale coverage report (Phase 28)
- [ ] **Run button**: builds the game and launches it in its own window; optionally opens directly to a selected scene (useful when iterating on a specific area)
- [ ] **Scene launch selector**: choose any registered scene as the start point before hitting Run
- [ ] **Engine log panel**: the running game pipes its spdlog output back to the editor over a named pipe or local socket; displayed in a filterable log panel in the editor
- [ ] **Event monitor panel**: live stream of Event Bus events from the running game (Phase 24); filterable by event name; shows payload and source entity
- [ ] Content export to Phase 38 folder layout (`project.arcbit` + `.arcasset` files via Phase 36 content tools)
- [ ] Asset importer UI: drag source files in, editor calls `arcbit-pack` and shows result
- [ ] **Editor mode detection**: on open, inspect the loaded `project.arcbit` to determine mode — full dev mode (dev key present) or restricted mod mode (mod key only, `mod_support = true`); mod mode disables save-over-original and shows a clear "Mod Editor" banner so end users know what they are working with
