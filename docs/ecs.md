# Arcbit ECS — Design Document

Phase 16 of the Arcbit blueprint. This document covers the architecture, API,
component catalogue, system execution order, and integration strategy for the
entity-component-system that all game objects will use from this phase forward.

---

## Why ECS, and why archetype-based?

The two mainstream ECS layouts are **sparse-set** (entt-style) and **archetype**
(Unity DOTS-style). Arcbit uses archetypes.

For a 2D RPG with largely stable entity compositions — players, NPCs,
decorations, terrain tiles — archetypes win on cache locality. All entities
with the same component set live in tightly-packed contiguous arrays. Iterating
"all entities with Transform2D + SpriteRenderer" walks a single hot array per
archetype with no pointer chasing. Component addition/removal (moving an entity
to a new archetype) is infrequent and happens at setup time, so the overhead
there is acceptable.

---

## Core Data Model

### Entity

A generational index that prevents use-after-free bugs:

```cpp
struct Entity {
    u32 Index;       // position in the entity table
    u32 Generation;  // incremented on destroy; stale handles are rejected
};
```

The entity table is a flat array mapping `Index → (Archetype*, slot, generation)`.
When an entity is destroyed its generation is bumped; any handle still held by
game code will fail the generation check and be rejected by the World.

### Component type IDs

Assigned once at program startup via a static counter template — no RTTI,
no macros, no registration boilerplate:

```cpp
template<typename T>
ComponentTypeID TypeOf() {
    static const ComponentTypeID id = TypeRegistry::NextID();
    return id;
}
```

IDs are contiguous integers starting at 0. The first call for a given `T`
assigns its ID; subsequent calls return the same value.

### Component mask

A `u64` bitmask where bit N is set when component `TypeID == N` is present.
This caps the engine at **64 distinct component types**, which is ample for
this project (approximately 20 are planned across all phases). Expanding to
`std::bitset<128>` is a one-line change if needed later.

### Archetype

A bucket that owns all entities sharing an identical component set:

```cpp
struct Archetype {
    ComponentMask                                      Mask;
    std::unordered_map<ComponentTypeID, ComponentArray> Columns;
    std::vector<Entity>                                 Entities;
};
```

All column vectors are the same length — entry N across every column belongs
to the same entity. Destroying an entity is a swap-and-pop on every column
simultaneously, keeping each array dense.

### World

Owns all archetypes and the entity table. Archetypes are looked up in O(1) via
an `unordered_map<ComponentMask, Archetype>`.

---

## Scene

`Scene` is the top-level container for a running game world. It owns the ECS
`World`, the active `Camera2D`, and the `WorldConfig` resource. This is the
abstraction that Phase 23 (`SceneManager`) will load, unload, and transition
between.

```
Scene
├── World          — all entities, archetypes, and systems
├── Camera2D       — active camera (driven by CameraFollowSystem)
└── WorldConfig    — scene-wide constants (tile size, gravity, bounds)
```

`Application` holds a `std::unique_ptr<Scene>` and exposes `GetScene()`.
Game code that previously accessed `Camera2D` directly now goes through
`GetScene().GetCamera()`.

### WorldConfig

Scene-wide constants that systems read instead of hard-coding per-entity:

```cpp
struct WorldConfig {
    f32  TileSize = 16.0f;           // world pixels per tile (used by tile movement systems)
    Vec2 Gravity  = { 0.0f, 0.0f }; // pixels/s² (zero = top-down, no gravity)
};
```

The game dev sets this once per scene. Movement style components never store
tile size — they read it from here.

---

## Required Components

Every entity **must** carry these two components. The World enforces this at
`CreateEntity` time.

| Component     | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `Transform2D` | World position, scale, and rotation — the canonical spatial state for every entity |
| `Tag`         | A single string classification used for filtering queries (`"Player"`, `"Enemy"`, `"Wall"`) |

`Tag` defaults to `"Entity"` if not supplied. `Transform2D` defaults to origin
with unit scale and zero rotation.

### Why not Name?

`Name` is intentionally **not** required. Terrain tiles, pooled enemies, and
decorative props do not need stored names — requiring them would create thousands
of unnecessary `std::string` allocations with no value.

The editor derives a display label on the fly from Tag + the first four
characters of the entity's scene-file UUID:

```
Wall   #3f25
Player #a91c
Chest  #77bd
```

`Name` is added explicitly for entities with game-design identity: the player,
named NPCs, quest objects, anything referenced by name in a dialog graph or
Lua script.

---

## Component Catalogue

### Transform2D *(required)*

```cpp
struct Transform2D {
    Vec2 Position = {};
    Vec2 Scale    = { 1.0f, 1.0f };
    f32  Rotation = 0.0f;            // radians, clockwise
};
```

The single source of truth for where an entity is in the world. All render and
movement systems read and write here.

### Tag *(required)*

```cpp
struct Tag {
    std::string Value = "Entity";
};
```

Used as a coarse filter in queries (see `WithTag()` below). Choosing a tag is
the game dev's responsibility; the engine has no reserved tag strings.

### Name *(optional)*

```cpp
struct Name {
    std::string Value;
};
```

Add only when the entity needs a stable human-readable identity. The editor
uses it in the entity list and dialog graph node pickers.

### SpriteRenderer *(optional)*

Visual representation without duplicating position (Transform2D owns that).

```cpp
struct SpriteRenderer {
    TextureHandle Texture;
    SamplerHandle Sampler;
    UVRect        UV     = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f };
    Color         Tint   = Color::White();
    i32           Layer  = 0;
};
```

`SpriteRenderSystem` reads `(Transform2D, SpriteRenderer)` and pushes a `Sprite`
into `FramePacket.Sprites`. Frustum culling is applied at this point. If the
entity also has a `Parallax` component the position is adjusted before submission
(see `Parallax` below).

UV rectangles come from `SpriteSheet`, which loads the unified Arcbit sprite
format (see `docs/sprite-format.md`). The format covers named frames, tile grids,
and animation clips in one file. The `Animator` component (Phase 17) will drive
`UV` automatically from the active clip; until then it is set directly by game
code via `SpriteSheet::GetTile` or `SpriteSheet::GetSprite`.

### LightEmitter *(optional)*

Light properties without position (Transform2D owns that).

```cpp
struct LightEmitter {
    f32   Radius     = 200.0f;
    f32   Intensity  = 1.0f;
    Color LightColor = Color::NaturalLight();
};
```

`LightRenderSystem` reads `(Transform2D, LightEmitter)`, applies frustum culling
via `Camera2D::IsLightVisible`, and pushes a `PointLight` into
`FramePacket.Lights`.

### Parallax *(optional)*

Scroll rate multiplier for background and foreground layers.

```cpp
struct Parallax {
    Vec2 ScrollFactor = { 0.5f, 0.5f };
    // 0.0 = fixed (sky, UI overlay)
    // 1.0 = normal world layer (moves 1:1 with camera)
    // 0.5 = mid-ground (moves at half camera speed)
};
```

`SpriteRenderSystem` adds `cameraPos * (1 - scrollFactor)` to the entity's world
position before submitting it to the packet. No Transform2D mutation; no extra
draw batches.

Derivation: the shader subtracts cameraPos from world position, so injecting
`cameraPos * (1 - s)` into world position gives an effective camera offset of
`cameraPos * s` — exactly the desired scroll rate.

### CameraTarget *(optional)*

Marks the entity the scene camera should follow. Only one entity should carry
this at a time; if multiple carry it, `CameraFollowSystem` picks the first one
found.

```cpp
struct CameraTarget {
    f32 Lag = 0.1f;  // lerp factor per second; 0.0 = instant snap, 1.0 = no follow
};
```

### Disabled *(optional)*

Empty marker component. All built-in systems use `.Without<Disabled>()` so
disabled entities are invisible to them. Useful for entity pooling, off-screen
NPCs, and inactive triggers.

```cpp
struct Disabled {};
```

### Lifetime *(optional)*

Auto-destroys the entity after a fixed duration. Intended for projectiles,
particles, and temporary effects.

```cpp
struct Lifetime {
    f32 Remaining;  // seconds until DestroyEntity is called
};
```

---

## Movement Components

Movement uses a **mix-and-match** design: a controller component decides
*where* the entity wants to go; a style component decides *how* it gets there.
Any controller pairs with any style.

### Controller components

#### InputMovement

```cpp
struct InputMovement {
    ActionID MoveLeft;
    ActionID MoveRight;
    ActionID MoveUp;
    ActionID MoveDown;
    f32      Speed = 100.0f;  // world pixels/s for FreeMovement; tiles/s for tile movement
};
```

`InputMovementSystem` reads the InputManager state each tick and writes a
movement request into whichever style component is present on the same entity.

#### AIMovement

```cpp
struct AIMovement {
    Vec2 TargetPosition;
    f32  Speed     = 100.0f;
    bool HasTarget = false;
};
```

Driven externally by the pathfinding system (Phase 30). `AIMovementSystem`
translates `TargetPosition` into the same movement request interface that
`InputMovementSystem` uses, so the style layer is shared.

### Style components

#### FreeMovement

Pixel-perfect velocity integration. Use for combat, platformer sections, or
any entity that needs sub-tile positioning.

```cpp
struct FreeMovement {
    Vec2 Velocity;
    f32  Friction = 8.0f;   // velocity multiplied by exp(-Friction * dt) each tick
    f32  MaxSpeed = 0.0f;   // clamp magnitude after integration; 0 = unlimited
};
```

#### SmoothTileMovement

Lerps from tile centre to tile centre. Input is queued during transit so the
next direction is consumed the moment the entity lands.

```cpp
struct SmoothTileMovement {
    f32  Speed     = 4.0f;    // tiles/second (tile size comes from WorldConfig)
    Vec2 OriginWorld;
    Vec2 TargetWorld;
    f32  Progress  = 1.0f;   // 0→1 lerp progress; 1.0 means arrived
    Vec2 QueuedDir;
    bool HasQueued = false;
};
```

#### SnapTileMovement

Moves instantly to the adjacent tile. No interpolation — suitable for puzzle
games and strict grid-based overworlds.

```cpp
struct SnapTileMovement {};  // tile size from WorldConfig; no per-entity state needed
```

### Pairing examples

| Entity | Controller | Style |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Overworld player | `InputMovement` | `SmoothTileMovement` |
| Puzzle NPC | `AIMovement` | `SnapTileMovement` |
| Combat enemy | `AIMovement` | `FreeMovement` |
| Combat player | `InputMovement` | `FreeMovement` |

---

## System Registration

Systems are registered as named `std::function` callbacks — no base class, no
virtual dispatch. Each system may provide an update function, a render-collect
function, or both.

```cpp
// Update system — runs every fixed tick
scene.GetWorld().RegisterSystem("FreeMovement",
    [](Scene& scene, f32 dt) {
        scene.GetWorld().Query<Transform2D, FreeMovement>()
            .Without<Disabled>()
            .Each([dt](Transform2D& t, FreeMovement& fm) {
                // integrate velocity, apply friction
            });
    });

// Render system — runs every frame, fills FramePacket
scene.GetWorld().RegisterRenderSystem("SpriteRender",
    [](Scene& scene, FramePacket& packet) {
        const Vec2 camPos = scene.GetCamera().GetEffectivePosition();
        scene.GetWorld().Query<Transform2D, SpriteRenderer>()
            .Without<Disabled>()
            .Each([&](Entity e, Transform2D& t, SpriteRenderer& s) {
                // parallax adjust, frustum cull, push to packet.Sprites
            });
    });
```

Systems execute in registration order. The engine registers all built-in
systems first; game code registers its systems in `OnStart` and they run after.

---

## Built-in System Execution Order

### Update phase (fixed timestep)

| Order | System | Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `LifetimeSystem` | `Lifetime` | destroys entity at zero |
| 2 | `InputMovementSystem` | `InputMovement`, InputManager | `FreeMovement.Velocity` or `SmoothTileMovement.QueuedDir` |
| 3 | `AIMovementSystem` | `AIMovement` | same targets as above |
| 4 | `FreeMovementSystem` | `FreeMovement` | `Transform2D.Position` |
| 5 | `SmoothTileMoveSystem` | `SmoothTileMovement`, `WorldConfig.TileSize` | `Transform2D.Position` |
| 6 | `SnapTileMoveSystem` | `SnapTileMovement`, `WorldConfig.TileSize` | `Transform2D.Position` |
| 7 | `CameraFollowSystem` | `CameraTarget`, `Transform2D` | `Scene.Camera2D` |

### Render-collect phase (variable rate, before SubmitFrame)

| Order | System | Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `SpriteRenderSystem` | `Transform2D`, `SpriteRenderer`, `Parallax`? | `FramePacket.Sprites` |
| 2 | `LightRenderSystem` | `Transform2D`, `LightEmitter` | `FramePacket.Lights` |

---

## Query API

### Basic query

Iterates all archetypes whose mask is a superset of the requested types. The
query object is stack-allocated and performs no heap allocation.

```cpp
world.Query<Transform2D, SpriteRenderer>()
     .Each([](Entity e, Transform2D& t, SpriteRenderer& s) { ... });
```

### Read-only access

Passing `const T` in the template signals read-only intent; the implementation
provides a `const T&` reference and may skip write-back in future SIMD paths.

```cpp
world.Query<const Transform2D, SpriteRenderer>()
     .Each([](const Transform2D& t, SpriteRenderer& s) { ... });
```

### Exclusion filter

```cpp
world.Query<Transform2D, FreeMovement>()
     .Without<Disabled>()
     .Each(...);
```

### Tag filter

A convenience wrapper that adds a `Tag.Value == tagString` predicate on top of
the component query. This is a linear scan over the Tag column of each matching
archetype; use it for low-frequency queries (setup, events) rather than
per-frame inner loops.

```cpp
world.Query<Transform2D>()
     .WithTag("Enemy")
     .Each([](Entity e, Transform2D& t) { ... });
```

For high-frequency filtering (e.g. "all active enemies each tick"), prefer a
dedicated marker component (`struct EnemyMarker {}`) over the string tag. Marker
components create a distinct archetype that the query can match directly via
bitmask with zero per-entity branching.

---

## Integration with Application

`Application::Run()` drives two phases per loop iteration:

```
[fixed tick]
  Scene::Update(dt)
    → World runs all registered update systems in order

[variable tick]
  FramePacket packet = ...
  Scene::CollectRenderData(packet)
    → World runs all registered render systems in order
  RenderThread::SubmitFrame(packet)
```

Game code retains `OnUpdate(dt)` and `OnRender(packet)` hooks. These run
**before** Scene::Update and Scene::CollectRenderData respectively, so they can
push manual sprites (debug overlays, UI, etc.) or manipulate entities before
systems process them.

---

## Scene File Format and Merge Safety

Scene files are JSON with one UUID-keyed object per entity. Each UUID is
randomly generated at entity-creation time in the editor.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "TileSize": 16.0,
    "Gravity": [0.0, 0.0]
  },
  "entities": {
    "3f2504e0-4f89-11d3-9a0c-0305e82c3301": {
      "Tag": "Player",
      "Name": "Kael",
      "Transform2D": { "Position": [0, 0], "Scale": [1, 1], "Rotation": 0 },
      "SpriteRenderer": { "Texture": "assets/textures/player.png", "Layer": 1 },
      "InputMovement": { "Speed": 4.0 },
      "SmoothTileMovement": { "Speed": 4.0 }
    },
    "7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7": {
      "Tag": "Wall",
      "Transform2D": { "Position": [48, 0] },
      "SpriteRenderer": { "Texture": "assets/textures/wall.png", "Layer": 0 }
    }
  }
}
```

**Merge safety:** two developers adding entities each produce new UUID keys in
the file. Git sees two new non-overlapping lines — no conflict. Conflicts only
arise when both developers edited the **same entity's component values**, which
is a genuine semantic conflict and is correctly surfaced for manual resolution.

**UUID is an editor and serialization concern only.** The runtime ECS uses
fast generational integer indices. The scene loader creates runtime entities from
the file and maintains a short-lived `map<UUID, Entity>` during loading to
resolve cross-references (e.g. a `CameraTarget` pointing to another entity by
UUID). That map is discarded after load.

The editor displays unnamed entities as `{Tag} #{uuid[0..3]}` (e.g.
`Wall #3f25`) — unique, human-parseable, zero storage overhead.

---

## File Layout

```

```

## Migration: Current Demo → ECS

The current `main.cpp` demo manually fills `_sprites` and `_lights` vectors and
culls them by hand in `OnRender`. After this phase it migrates to:

1. Create entities with `Transform2D + SpriteRenderer` for each sprite.
2. Create entities with `Transform2D + LightEmitter` for each light source.
3. Add `InputMovement + FreeMovement` to the camera-controlled entity (or keep
   the WASD camera pan as manual `OnUpdate` code — either is valid during the
   transition period).
4. Delete `_sprites`, `_lights`, and the manual cull loops — `SpriteRenderSystem`
   and `LightRenderSystem` handle everything.
5. The `Camera2D` moves from being a game-owned member to `scene.GetCamera()`.

The demo can migrate incrementally: manual sprites and ECS sprites both feed
into `FramePacket.Sprites` and are rendered identically.

---

## Out of Scope for This Phase

- Scene serialization / load / save (Phase 23)
- SceneManager, scene transitions (Phase 23)
- Lua scripting of entities (Phase 26)
- Physics integration — `Rigidbody2D`, `Collider2D` (Phase 22)
- Animation system — `Animator` component, clip playback (Phase 17)
- `AudioSource` component (Phase 18)
- Editor integration — entity inspector, UUID generation, scene file authoring (Phase 40)
